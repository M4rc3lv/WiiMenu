# WiiMenu
This is a remake of the Wii home screen that can be used on 16:9 screens like with a resolution of 1920x1080 pixels.
A real nifty feature is that the screen tubes look really rounded on both the horizontal as the vertical axis. This is done in CSS only.

The website can be run locally using php -S and then it has a feature to detect an Arduino Leonardo connected to the PC.
